# Excel based Crypto dashboard
## Description

ü™ô It is a fun and useful project that I created. This Excel-based tool can make cryptocurrency portfolio tracking easy and interactive. It's like a financial playground for crypto enthusiasts and data lovers. It's powered by real-time data from the CoinMarketCap API. It shows only a fraction of the possibilies which can be achieved, like analysis of past prices or gathering information about crypto trends.

üó∫Ô∏è To kick things off, I needed a reliable source of crypto data, and that's where CoinMarketCap's API comes into play. There is a basic free plan which has enabled me to access the API which later will provide me necessary data. TO get the access I had to register to the developer portal.
